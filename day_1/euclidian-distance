#Find an Euclidian distance between (2, 3) (p1, p2) and (10, 8) (q1, q2)
#The formula is a2 + b2 = c2
#when you have two coordinate points the euclidian distance between the two is ((p1-q1)**2 + (p2-q2)**2)**0.5
p1 = 2
p2 = 3

q1 = 10
q2 = 8 

distance = ((p1-q1)**2 + (p2-q2)**2)**0.5

print(distance)
